# ⚠️ BIG UPDATE ⚠️

I created a big package manager instead of a fake package manager and have added a lot more commands to Version 2.0

PyOS will automatically Launch Version 2.0

# How to run PyOS
Download Update 4 then run `install.py`. This will install all of the libraries necessary to run PyOS, then run PyOS.

# Need Help?
Launch PyOS, then type `-h` for help.

# Update Log?
Launch PyOS, then type `-ul` for the update log.
